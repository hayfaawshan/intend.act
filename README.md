# intend. act. 

## App purpose
intend. act. is a web app designed to help organisations and their employees reflect and act upon their diversity and inclusion (D&I) practices. 

Research shows that existing D&I training often lacks impact because it’s not sufficiently ‘context-specific or action-oriented’, and because ‘a lot of organizations think that training is a ‘one and done’ thing’ (https://envoy.com/blog/how-unconscious-bias-affects-workplace-experience/). intend. act. solves this problem by facilitating an ongoing, action-oriented D&I process that can be tailored to the context of each organisation and each employee. Featuring capabilities that allow users to set personal intentions, create new communities, and learn from each other, intend. act. takes users on an intersectional, holistic and personalised journey to grow as advocates for themselves and for others.

## App users
The primary users of the app will be the employees of an organisation. Each employee will have a personal account, via which they can access the features of the app. Each employee will be able to tailor the settings of their account to suit their own D&I development. It is intended that every employee of the organisation will have their own employee account, regardless of seniority. 

In addition to this, the organisation’s leadership will have access to an employer-view dashboard, via which the leadership will be able to make macro changes to tailor the app to suit the organisation as a whole.

## App structure overview and navigation
Once they have set up an account, each user of intend. act. has access to three principal home areas: the journey home, the today & upcoming home, and the community home. The three home pages are situated on the top navigation level of the app, and the user can easily navigate between them. 

Related app features and content branch from the home pages, and the user can easily navigate back from the branches to the top-level home pages via the navigation bar.
